      educate you on the benefits of houseplants and encourage you to realize that, no matter
      your skill level, there is a plant available for you to be able to grow in your home. But before
      we get down to earth in the dirt of hosueplants, I need to start with space, and with NASA
      to be specific.</p>

      NASA understood that plants could clean the air, and they were interested in seeing if small houseplants, which were already shown to survive in containers, could be used as a means of cleaning the air in space stations, rather than expensive air filtering equipment. More specifically, they wanted to see if the plants could remove common chemicals in the air that could be harmful to human health. These chemicals were:

        <p>Benzene is a natural constituent of crude oil and is one of the most common industrial
        chemicals in use, usually used as an intermediate to make other chemicals, most of which
        are used mainly in plastics and synthetic fibers. As a result, it it present at low levels
        in a wide array of products. Benzene is considered a carcinogen to both humans and animals,
        targeting the liver, kidneys, heart, brain, and bone marrow. It can cause DNA and chromosomial
        damage and can cause leukemia in sufficient levels. OSHA recommends a maximum exposure limit of
        0.1 ppm over 8 hours.</p>

          system, although it can also affect the liver and kidneys, causing intoxication similar to that
          of alcohol. SCOEL lists the maximum exposure limit of 10 ppm over 8 hours, or 30 ppm for a short

      NASA sealed a variety of plants in containers with these chemicals present and measured the amount that was absorbed by the plants. They also did this with the plants trimmed away, and discovered that it is not only the plant that removes the chemicals from the air, but the bacteria in the soil that the plants’ root systems cultivated. But why did NASA decide to use houseplants and not other plants? Well, for space constraints, of course. But houseplants also tend to have a better survival rate for indoor conditions, which can be hostile to plants. Let’s take a look at why this is.

    <p class="text-block">There are several criteria that make for a good houseplant. The interior of a person's home,
    particularly in homes in areas with a distinct winter season, can be difficult for a houseplant
    to survive in. Let's look at some of the factors that can affect a plant's success and see if we can
    find the best houseplant to clean the air and fit your needs.</p>

    <h2 class="header">Light</h2>
    <p class="text-block">Many plants have difficulty indoors due to low lighting. As a result, many indoor
    plants are tropical understory plants, which are used to lower light levels.</p>
    <p>When picking a plant for your home, it cna be easiest to start by going off which way your
    window faces on a compass bearing. North generally gets the least, and south the most (at least, in north
    America that is).</p>
    <p>How about selecting the light levels in the place where you'd like your plant? Places right
    next to windows get the more light than interior spaces, and southern windows provide more light
    than northern windows.</p>
