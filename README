- More content for space section
- Change the space selection to a scale that can be adjusted for height and width, and will affect
  and image of a window to the side
- Water section needs more content; need to focus on frequency/reliability of watering for plant
  measuring input
- Need some kind of image or animation to go with water

- Refine selectors for plant toxicity and image for section
- If no plants are available due to toxicity exposure, need to provide alternative section on how
  to prevent animals/kids from eating potentially poisonous plants and how to react if they do

***Plant Library Page***
- Make sure all plant images are legal to modify and reuse
- Alter pics so that the backgrounds are consistent
- Review plant descriptions, create more space below them so they aren't right against the bottom
  of their container
- Clarify the chemical levels for each plant. Right now they're just abstract numbers
- For chem levels, consider animated horizontal bar graph for more effects
- Check spacing for header title
- Text should not be black, match other content color
- Remove top and bottom border for plant sections? Color difference kind of does that for you

***General***

- Chase down the error that is appearing in the console on the browser
- Clean up backend/ database connections

Bugs:
- Can't get bootstrap css affix to stick the nav to the top of the screen when you scroll down


Site Overview:
Reforming the layout of the page to progress down through explanation of NASA air study
to picking well suited plant and calculating air cleaning while describing experiment. Show
top plants on a person's list along the way, as well as other plants that might be secondary fits.
Plant library will have more animations and interactivity.
