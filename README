PROJECT NOTES

To Do List:

***Plantulate Page*** (6 Days)

- space slider will affect an image of a window to the side
- Water section needs more content; need to focus on frequency/reliability of watering for plant
  measuring input
- Need some kind of image or animation to go with water
- Toxicity section needs more content
- Refine selectors for plant toxicity and image for section
- If no plants are available due to toxicity exposure, need to provide alternative section on how
  to prevent animals/kids from eating potentially poisonous plants and how to react if they do
- Suggest Plants button needs refinement
- Section for suggest plants?
- Suggested plants need to be displayed better
- Create plant logos
- Create plant representations for selections at end.
- Add icons for plants and molecules in NASA section
- Need to animate the scroll to next section for each section
- Scroll button styling
- Create scroll button icon (down-arrow)
- Animate molecules on hover
- Add animated gif for houseplants section


***Plant Library Page*** (2 Days)
- Make sure all plant images are legal to modify and reuse
- Alter pics so that the backgrounds are consistent
- Review plant descriptions, create more space below them so they aren't right against the bottom
  of their container
- Clarify the chemical levels for each plant. Right now they're just abstract numbers
- For chem levels, consider animated horizontal bar graph for more effects
- Check spacing for header title
- Text should not be black, match other content color
- Remove top and bottom border for plant sections? Color difference kind of does that for you

***General*** (Part of Plant Library Timeline)
- Does this site need a footer? Could add social icons, contact info to me
- Chase down the error that is appearing in the console on the browser
- Clean up backend/ database connections

Bugs:
- Can't get bootstrap css affix to stick the nav to the top of the screen when you scroll down
- space around image for lightscale is also changing lightness with scaling because it's exposed background
  sub: will need to separate lightbox div from img element and layer over one another to have smaller lightbox behind image

Site Overview:
Reforming the layout of the page to progress down through explanation of NASA air study
to picking well suited plant and calculating air cleaning while describing experiment. Show
top plants on a person's list along the way, as well as other plants that might be secondary fits.
Plant library will have more animations and interactivity.
